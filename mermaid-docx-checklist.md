# Mermaid-Docx Conversion Checklist

## Working Solution Components
- [x] Pandoc as the base conversion tool
- [x] mermaid-filter for rendering diagrams
- [x] Local npm package installations (no global installs)
- [x] Error logging and capture

## Things That Didn't Work
- [ ] Global installation of svg-to-png (permission issues)
- [ ] Overly complex solutions beyond the basic pandoc + mermaid-filter approach

## Local Setup Requirements
- [ ] Node.js and npm installed on the system
- [ ] Pandoc installed on the system
- [ ] Local installation of mermaid-filter
- [ ] Local installation of svg-to-png (if needed)

## Best Practices
- Always install npm packages with `--save-dev` or `--save` flags to track dependencies
- Use `npx` to run locally installed packages
- Capture and log errors for troubleshooting
- Verify prerequisites at the beginning of scripts
- Use local paths relative to the project directory

## Steps for Robust Implementation
1. Create a package.json if not exists (`npm init -y`)
2. Install required packages locally (`npm install --save-dev mermaid-filter svg-to-png`)
3. Create simplified script that uses local node_modules
4. Add error handling and logging
5. Test with simple examples before complex documents
